# mastermind
A mastermind- inspired game I created in my AP CS A course
The game runs in the terminal by running the MasterMind.java file. 
I developed this game by adding my own code to the templetes provided
in my AP CS A course (the templetes included the basic stucture of the class-
method signatures, class headers, etc., while I added the code for the logic of the
game to make the game run.
